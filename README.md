# Suricata-Live-Network-Traffic-Capture-Intrusion-Detection-System-IDS-Setup
This project focused on setting up a blue team IDS using Suricata for live traffic capture and alerting based on network threats. The goal was to help monitor network activity and detect potential attacks like DDoS or port scanning, which were simulated using tools like nmap.
Tools I used: 
Suricata (IDS/IPS for live network capture and traffic analysis)
Kali Linux (VM setup for the defender node)
nmap (Network scanning tool to simulate attacks)
fast.log (Log file to view alerts generated by Suricata)
